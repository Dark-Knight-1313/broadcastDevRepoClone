Bring the liquid to a full boil. Add Crabplace.com hand-selected live crabs. Layer the crabs in the steamer pot and add seasoning to taste. Cover the steamer and place it on the boiler pot letting the crabs steam until they're bright red (approx 20 minutes).<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>Re-heating—<\/strong>If re-heating already steamed crabs, reduce steam time to 5 minutes and test a crab by cracking a claw. If the meat is hot, the crabs are done. If the meat is not hot, allow the crabs to steam for another 5 minutes and test again. You can also reheat steamed crabs in the microwave. Place a damp paper towel over them to keep them moist and cook on high for 1 to 2 minutes. Or warm them in the oven for approximately 10 minutes at 375 degrees.Cover your table with heavy brown paper or newspaper and set out crab mallets, crab knives, plastic beer cups, paper towels, vinegar and melted butter for dipping, and extra seasoning. Dump the hot crabs in the middle. Be sure to grab one before they are gone! There is no appreciable loss of quality from reheating, but keep in mind that the crabs have already been cooked, and that steaming longer than 10 minutes will cause the meat to dry out.Although we season our steamed crabs before they are shipped, adding seasoning will make your steamed crab experience more memorable. We recommend Old Bay Seasoning available in most grocery stores.<\/p>","text_size":4,"text_style":"font-body"}},"template--20536404050237__b23bc3ff-3ba8-45f5-8242-8659e92437af-buttons-1":{"type":"buttons","settings":{"button_text":"Read More","button_url":"","button_type":"btn--primary","button_size":"","button_style":"btn--solid","show_arrow":true}}},"block_order":["template--20536404050237__b23bc3ff-3ba8-45f5-8242-8659e92437af-heading-1","template--20536404050237__b23bc3ff-3ba8-45f5-8242-8659e92437af-text-1","template--20536404050237__b23bc3ff-3ba8-45f5-8242-8659e92437af-buttons-1"],"settings":{"width":"wrapper","align_text":"text-left","bg_color":"","color":"{{ shop.brand.colors.primary[0].background }}","padding_top":12,"padding_bottom":22}},"faq":{"type":"section-accordion","blocks":{"faq-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Frequently asked question","text":"<p>Use this to answer some common questions you hear from your customers.
